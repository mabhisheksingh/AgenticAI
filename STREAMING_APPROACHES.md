# LangGraph Streaming Approaches

## Overview

This implementation provides two different approaches for streaming chat responses, each with its own benefits and use cases.

## üîÑ **Approach 1: Hybrid (Default)**

### What it does:
- **Token-level streaming** directly from LLM for real-time user experience
- **LangGraph state management** for conversation history and checkpointing
- **Manual coordination** between streaming and state persistence

### How it works:
1. Load conversation history from LangGraph checkpointer
2. Stream tokens directly from `llm.astream()` for real-time response
3. Save complete conversation back to LangGraph using `graph.invoke()`

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **Real-time token streaming** - Users see tokens as they're generated
- ‚úÖ **LangGraph benefits** - Full state management, checkpointing, workflow tracking
- ‚úÖ **Best user experience** - Immediate "Thinking..." hiding on first token
- ‚úÖ **Proven reliability** - Combines the best of both worlds

### Use when:
- You need real-time token-by-token streaming
- User experience is the top priority
- You want immediate visual feedback

## üéØ **Approach 2: Pure LangGraph**

### What it does:
- **Full LangGraph workflow** orchestration and streaming
- **Native LangGraph streaming** using `astream()` 
- **Node-level streaming** with complete workflow integration

### How it works:
1. Load conversation history from LangGraph checkpointer
2. Stream through LangGraph's native `astream()` workflow
3. Handle node-level streaming events from LangGraph

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **Pure LangGraph** - Full workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ **Native streaming** - Uses LangGraph's intended streaming system
- ‚úÖ **Automatic state management** - Everything handled by LangGraph
- ‚úÖ **Workflow integrity** - Complete node execution tracking

### Use when:
- You prefer pure LangGraph architecture
- You need full workflow orchestration
- Node-level streaming is sufficient
- You want minimal hybrid complexity

## üöÄ **Usage**

### Frontend Request Format:

```javascript
// Default hybrid approach
const request = {
    message: "Hello!",
    thread_id: null,
    thread_label: "New conversation",
    approach: "hybrid"  // Optional, defaults to "hybrid"
}

// Pure LangGraph approach
const request = {
    message: "Hello!",
    thread_id: null,
    thread_label: "New conversation", 
    approach: "pure_langgraph"
}
```

### Backend API:

```python
# Automatically routes to the appropriate method
POST /v1/agent/chat
{
    "message": "Hello!",
    "thread_id": null,
    "thread_label": "New conversation",
    "approach": "hybrid" | "pure_langgraph"
}
```

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### Method Mapping:
- `async_execute_hybrid()` - Hybrid approach (LLM streaming + LangGraph state)
- `async_execute_pure_langgraph()` - Pure LangGraph workflow streaming
- `async_execute()` - Router method that delegates based on `approach` parameter

### State Management:
- **Hybrid**: Manual coordination between streaming and checkpointing
- **Pure LangGraph**: Automatic through LangGraph's workflow system

### Response Format:
Both approaches return the same SSE format:
```json
data: {"type": "token", "content": "Hello", "metadata": {"node": "chat_model", "approach": "hybrid"}}
data: [DONE]
```

## üìä **Comparison**

| Feature | Hybrid | Pure LangGraph |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Token-level streaming | ‚úÖ Real-time | ‚ùå Node-level only |
| LangGraph benefits | ‚úÖ Full support | ‚úÖ Native support |
| User experience | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Architecture purity | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Complexity | Medium | Low |
| Reliability | High | High |

## üéØ **Recommendation**

- **Use Hybrid (default)** for production applications where user experience is critical
- **Use Pure LangGraph** for applications where architectural purity is more important than token-level streaming

The system defaults to the hybrid approach for the best balance of user experience and LangGraph benefits.
